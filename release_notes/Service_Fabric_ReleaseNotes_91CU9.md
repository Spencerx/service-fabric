## Retirement and Deprecation Path Callouts

* Service Fabric runtime will discontinue support for the Java SDK soon. For a smooth transition, we strongly recommend users to shift to Azure Service Fabric .NET SDK. If your current setup is based on the Service Fabric Java SDK, we suggest starting migration plans to smoothly switch to the Azure Service Fabric .NET SDK. Although applications using the Java SDK will continue to work, we highly recommend adopting the SF .NET SDK for optimal outcomes.

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS has reached its 5-year end-of-life window on June-2023. Service Fabric runtime has dropped support for 18.04 LTS after the published date, and we recommend moving your clusters and applications to supported versions listed here: [Service Fabric supported Linux versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-versions#supported-linux-versions-and-support-end-date)

* Service Fabric runtime will soon stop supporting BinaryFormatter based remoting exception serialization by default and move to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception serialization by default. Current applications using it will continue to work as-is, but Service Fabric strongly recommends moving to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception instead.

* Previously communicated, Service Fabric runtime had planned to remove Service Fabric runtime version 6.4 packages and older, as well as SDK version 3.3 packages and older, from the package Download Center in July 2023. We would like to inform you that this timeline has been extended, and the removal will now take place in January 2024.

* Service Fabric runtime will soon be archiving and removing Service Fabric runtime versions less than 7.2 and older, as well as the corresponding SDK version 4.2 packages and older from the package Download Center. Archiving/Removing will affect application scaling and re-imaging of virtual machines in a Service Fabric Cluster running on unsupported versions. After older versions are removed/archived, this may cause failure while rolling back when the current in-progress upgrade has errors. 
  * To prevent disruption of workloads, create a new cluster using the following steps:
    * [Create a Service Fabric cluster using ARM template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/quickstart-cluster-template)
    * [Create a Standalone cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-creation-for-windows-server)
    * Install the supported version of Service Fabric SDK based on the Runtime version installed on the cluster.
